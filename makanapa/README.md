## 4. Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture with Feature-First Structure

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles using a **feature-first** approach, making each feature self-contained and the codebase easy to navigate.

```text
lib/
├── core/              # Shared utilities, theme, widgets, configs
├── features/          # Feature modules
│   ├── home/
│   │   ├── data/          # API & DB implementations
│   │   ├── domain/        # Business logic & interfaces
│   │   ├── presentation/  # UI, controllers, state
│   │   └── provider/      # Dependency injection
│   ├── recipe/
│   ├── profile/
│   └── ...
└── shared/            # Cross-feature shared code
```

### Three-Layer Architecture

**Domain Layer** (Pure Business Logic)
- Repository interfaces
- Domain models
- Use cases

**Data Layer** (Data Management)
- Repository implementations
- Remote data sources (Supabase API)
- Local data sources (Isar DB)
- DTOs and entity models

**Presentation Layer** (UI)
- Screens and components
- Controllers (Riverpod/Bloc)
- UI state management

### Offline-First Data Flow

```
UI → Controller → Repository → Remote API → Save to Isar DB
                                                    ↓
                                              Stream Event
                                                    ↓
                  Controller ← Listen to Stream ← Isar DB
                       ↓
                  Update State
                       ↓
                  UI Re-renders
```

**How it works:**
1. App loads cached data from Isar instantly (offline support)
2. Fresh data fetched from API and saved to Isar
3. Isar emits stream event on data change
4. Controller listens and updates UI automatically

## 6. Design Decisions

### Why Clean Architecture?
- **Scalability** – Easy to add new features without impacting existing code
- **Testability** – Each layer can be tested independently with clear boundaries
- **Maintainability** – Changes in one layer don't ripple through the entire codebase
- **Team Collaboration** – Clear structure makes it easier for multiple developers to work simultaneously

### Why Hybrid State Management (Riverpod + Bloc)?
- **Demonstrates Versatility** – Shows proficiency in multiple modern Flutter patterns
- **Practical Flexibility** – Riverpod for simple MVVM patterns, Bloc for complex MVI flows
- **Interview Ready** – Accessible to developers familiar with either approach
- **Learning Showcase** – Highlights deep understanding of Flutter state management evolution

### Why Isar Database?
- **Reactive Streams** – Native stream support perfect for offline-first architecture
- **Developer Experience** – Built-in web inspector makes debugging intuitive
- **Performance** – Fast NoSQL database optimized for mobile
- **Type Safety** – Strong typing with code generation reduces runtime errors

### Why Supabase over Firebase?
- **PostgreSQL Power** – Full relational database capabilities with RLS security
- **Edge Functions** – Serverless API with better AI code generation support
- **Open Source** – Self-hostable with no vendor lock-in
- **Cost Effective** – Generous free tier for portfolio projects

### Why Feature-First Structure?
- **Screaming Architecture** – Folder structure clearly communicates app features
- **Modularity** – Each feature is self-contained and independently deployable
- **Scalability** – Easy to add, remove, or modify features without affecting others
- **Team Organization** – Features can be owned by different team members
