## 5. Architecture Overview

This project adheres to **Clean Architecture** principles, organized using a **Feature-First** (Screaming Architecture) directory structure. This ensures that the codebase is scalable, maintainable, and testable, with a clear separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data handling.

### 📂 Directory Structure

The project structure is designed to reveal "what the app does" at a glance. Common utilities reside in `core`, while specific business capabilities are encapsulated within `features`.

### 🏗 Layer Separation

The application is divided into three distinct layers:

#### 1. Domain Layer (Inner Layer)
*   The core of the application logic. It is purely written in Dart and has no dependencies on external libraries (like Flutter, HTTP, or Databases).
*   **Contents:** Abstract Repository definitions and pure Domain Models.

#### 2. Data Layer (Outer Layer)
*   Responsible for coordinating data from different sources.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **Data Sources:** Abstract and concrete implementations for Remote (API) and Local (Isar DB).
    *   **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Handles serialization/deserialization for APIs (`ResponseApi`) and Database Tables (`EntityLocal`).
    *   **Repository Implementation:** The bridge that connects the Domain repositories to the actual Data Sources.

#### 3. Presentation Layer (UI Layer)
*   Responsible for painting the screen and handling user interaction.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **Screens & Components:** Flutter Widgets.
    *   **Controllers:** Manages `UI State`, side effects (`UI Effect`), and business logic using **Riverpod**.
    *   **Providers:** Dependency injection definitions.

### 🔄 Data Flow & Caching Strategy

The app implements a **Reactive / Offline-First** repository pattern using **Isar Database** as the single source of truth for the UI.

1.  **Trigger:** The UI triggers an action via the **Controller** (Riverpod).
2.  **Fetch & Store:** The **Repository** fetches fresh data from the **Remote DataSource**.
3.  **Persist:** Instead of returning data directly to the UI, the Repository saves the result into the **Local DataSource** (Isar DB).
4.  **Reactive Stream:** The Local Database emits a stream of updated data.
5.  **Update UI:** The **Controller** listens to this stream and updates the `UI State`.

**Flow Visualization:**
`UI -> Controller -> Repository -> Remote API -> Save to Isar DB -> Stream Update -> Controller -> UI Render`

## 6. Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
*   **Flutter SDK**: `3.35.6` (Stable Channel)
*   **Dart SDK**: `3.9.2`
*   **Make**: Required to run the custom build commands.

### 📥 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### 🔐 Environment Configuration

This project relies on **Build Flavors** (Staging & Production) and requires specific environment configurations.

1.  Locate the `environment.env.example` file in the root directory.
2.  Create two new files in the root directory:
    *   `environment_staging.env`
    *   `environment_production.env`
3.  Fill in the required secrets (API Keys, URLs) in both files.

### 🔥 Firebase Setup (Google Sign-In)

1.  Create a project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Android:**
    *   Add your local **debug SHA-1 key** to the Firebase project settings.
    *   Download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`.
3.  **iOS:**
    *   Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `ios/Runner/`.

### ⚡ Supabase Setup

1.  Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2.  **Database Schema & Edge Functions:**
    *   Navigate to the `master/` folder in this repository.
    *   Apply the provided SQL schema to your new Supabase project.
    *   Deploy the Edge Functions found in this directory.
3.  Add your Supabase URL and Anon Key to your `.env` files.

### 🏗 Code Generation

This project uses **Riverpod** and **Isar**, requiring code generation. A `Makefile` is provided for convenience.

Run the following command to generate the necessary code:

```bash
make build_runner
```

### 🚀 Run the App

This project uses **Flavors** and cannot be run with a standard `flutter run` command. You must specify the flavor and entry point.

#### Option A: VS Code (Recommended)
This project includes a `.vscode/launch.json` configuration.
1.  Go to the **Run and Debug** tab in VS Code.
2.  Select either **"Makan Apa App (Staging)"** or **"Makan Apa App (Production)"**.
3.  Press **F5** (Start Debugging).

#### Option B: Terminal
Use the following commands to run the specific flavor:

**Staging:**
```bash
flutter run --flavor staging -t lib/main_staging.dart
```

**Production:**
```bash
flutter run --flavor production -t lib/main_prod.dart
```
## 8. Design Decisions

The architectural choices in this project were made not just to build a functional app, but to demonstrate advanced engineering principles and explore different paradigms within the Flutter ecosystem.

### 🏛 Clean Architecture
I adopted **Clean Architecture** to bridge the gap between intermediate and senior-level development. This structure ensures the application is highly **scalable** and **reliable**. By decoupling the layers, I focused on sharpening my skills in designing pure, testable business logic independent of the UI, adhering to industry standards for maintainable software.

### 🔀 Hybrid State Management (Riverpod & BLoC)
This project utilizes a unique hybrid approach, implementing both **Riverpod** and **BLoC**. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in the two most battle-tested solutions in the industry:

*   **Riverpod (MVVM):** Used primarily for Dependency Injection (DI) and managing UI state. It offers compile-time safety and a refined developer experience.
*   **BLoC (MVI):** Integrated into specific features to implement the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** pattern. This allows for a direct comparison between MVVM and MVI paradigms within the same codebase.

### 💾 Isar Database
**Isar** was selected as the local storage solution for two key reasons:
1.  **Reactive Streams:** Its native support for watching queries allows it to act as a reactive **Single Source of Truth**, updating the UI automatically when data changes.
2.  **Developer Experience:** The built-in **Isar Inspector** provides a real-time visual editor for the database while the app is running, which significantly simplifies debugging and data verification.
